# AlgoGenie
AI-Powered DSA Problem Solver

•	Developed an intelligent multi-agent system using the AutoGen framework to automatically solve Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems with real-time code generation and execution.
•	Implemented a Docker-based sandboxed execution environment to ensure secure and isolated code testing and validation.
•	Built an interactive Streamlit web interface with real-time streaming, enabling users to submit DSA queries and receive AI-generated solutions with live execution feedback.
•	Integrated Groq LLM for high-performance code generation and problem-solving, using asynchronous processing to efficiently handle multiple concurrent requests.
